	  	<h1>On the day</h1>
  		<p>Here are a few things important for the day:
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure the room has drinks and snacks. If you are going to have a room it's great to ensure that has water and snacks for your contributor. They are going to be working hard so lets reward them!</li>
          <li>If you plan to use slides check the venue can use them.</li>
          <li>Try and get a room with a board to write things like useful urls out.</li>
          <li>Take the names of the people attending as we as a team would love to know and follow up with them after. It's useful to get the wordpress.org username and full name.</li>
        </ul>
