      <h1>The review</h1>
      <p>
    Every review looks at both required items and recommended ones. Required items should all be met, recommended items are suggestions but you can't not approve a theme because of them.</p>

        When you write your ticket response to a theme here is a suggested way of doing that:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>‘Welcome wrapper’.</strong> Say Hi to the author, let them know what you are going to do. This may be their first review.</li>
          <li><strong>Say the outcome.</strong> Let the author know from the start what the outcome is.</li>
          <li><strong>Required.</strong> List all the required items, a theme can’t be approved until all of these are met.</li>
          <li><strong>Recommended.</strong> You can then list all the recommended items. These won’t be a grounds to not approve, but they are good theme practice.</li>
          <li><strong>Notes.</strong> This could be a section where you add design notes, maybe additional information. Again, this can’t be something you don’t approve because, but it can be a way to educate.</li>
          <li><strong>Say what is going to happen next.</strong> Keeping the author informed is great. Let them know you will let them upload a new version or what the approval process is.
Using the headings ‘Required, Recommended and Notes’ is really helpful for people when viewing the review.</li>
        </ul>

      <p>If you are able to use the internet we'd advise you use the online versions of the theme review handbook. We have a minimal version online though in the next steps.</p>
