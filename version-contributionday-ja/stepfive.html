      The first review you are going to be doing is on a theme that has all sorts broken. We refer to this theme as simple doing_it_wrong. The theme comes included in this Contributor pack. The person organising the session should have downloaded it or you get can it <a href="https://github.com/WPTRT/doingitwrong/">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Over the next few steps we will take you through how you should do your review. This review format will apply to every review you do in the future.</p>
